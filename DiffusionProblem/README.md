# Routines to Solve the Diffusion Problem

   This directory contains all rountines to solve the diffusive part of the *temperature conservation equation* (1- and 2-D) using different numerical discretization methods. For more details on the discretization methods see the Numerical . The routines are avaible for a dimensional or non-dimensional (files ending with *Sc.m) form of the equation.
