# ATTENTION!!! <br>
**The benchmarks do work and have been tested briefly. The introduction and analysis for each benchmark is added here from time to time, but for the sake of time managment, this needed to be pushed backwards a little bit. In case information is missing within each directory, this information should be added within the near future! I am happy for any comments or suggestions.**
