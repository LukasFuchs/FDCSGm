# ATTENTION!!!

**The benchmarks do work and have been tested briefly. The introduction and analysis for each benchmark is added here from time to time, but for the sake of time managment, this needed to be pushed backwards a little bit. In case information is missing within each directory, this information should be added within the near future! References are added from time to time. I am happy for any comments or suggestions.** 

# Benchmarks 
## Blanckenbach 
A well-known, two dimensional, thermal convection benchmark by Blankenbach et al., (1989). 

## Channel Flow
A comparison of a two dimensional channel flow (Couette- and Couette-Poiseuille flow) with constant and variable solution with its analytical solution. 

## Falling Block
A well known benchmark of a falling block within an isoviscous medium and a certain density and viscosity contrast. An excellent benchmark to test the advection of material and the stokes solution. 

## Gaussian Diffusion 
A two dimensional Benchmark to test the accuracy of the thermal diffusion solvers with respect to the analytical, transient solution of an initial Gaussian temperature distribution. 

## Rayleigh Taylor Instability 
A two dimensional benchmark to test the code for the solution of the stokes equation by calculating the growth rate of a density perturbation with its analytical solution. This is a good benchmark to test the stokes solution and the advection of material. 

## Spherical Viscous Inclusion 
A two-dimensional benchmark to compar the numerical solution of the stoke equation for a viscous inclusion within an viscous medium with its analytical solution.
