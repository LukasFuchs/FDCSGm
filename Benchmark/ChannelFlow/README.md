[NSE_test_deriv.m](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/FDCSGm/blob/main/Benchmark/ChannelFlow/NSE_test_deriv.m)<br>
&emsp; -> Script to calculate the 1-D stokes solution for a Couette-(Poiseuille) channel flow with variable viscosity using different finite discretization schemes (staggered, centered 2nd order, centered 4th order, chain rule) and compare it to its analytical solution.
